# Lab 1

The first lab assignment we was given in the first week was a Guessing Game. In this lecture we learnt the basic of python and made the game. In this project a random number is generated when you run the program and the user has to find the number by guessing. You have 10 tries to find it and each time you make a guess the program will give you a hint and tell you whether the number is higher or lower. If you run out of tries the program will display a message saying you lost and end the program. However, if you win and guess the correct number you will be granted a victory message and the program will end.

# Lab 5

In the 5th Lab activity we were tasked with making a sudoku game where the user can input a row, column and number to play a sudoku game in python. This was a challenging task that was in my opinion the hardest seen as we had to make it using if statements. In the game the user will be displayed a sudoku board and the user can input a number where ever there is a "0". Additionally, if a number is already there the user can change it and if the user cannot place the number (an example being 2 numbers on the same row) then the program will tell the user that it is incorrect. Below is the sudoku board I used as a template and to get the user thinking and below is the solution.

# Lab 6

In Lab 6 the task was to make a task manager for days of the weeks and months of the year using while loops. These loops will make a continuous input system where the user can add tasks, view tasks, delete tasks and exit the program. The program will always loop back to the main menu when the program has executed what the user input.

# code readability and maintainability

500 words write up about explanations of the importance of code readability and maintainability.

When coding making comments and ensuring indentations are correct is essential to a good program. Firstly, it makes collaborating with other programmers easier, an example of this would be explaining parts of the project to other programmers and explaining the code with the assistance of the comments. Furthermore, if you are unable to explain the program to them, they can infer from the comments left by you previously to either continue on a collaborative work or understand how to use a program. On top of this, comments can be used to leave instructions to a partner in a project which makes collaboration important. Another aspect to consider about readability is indentation. Correct indentation is essential for a program to work in python, and it makes the program look approachable. Furthermore, keeping a consistant use of indentation so the flow of the program stays the same throughout the whole project. When considering readability naming schemes are important to the program to gurantee that the program stays the same and it is easy to understand. An example of proper naming is "student_table" or "studentTable". These are the most common forms of naming in programming and are crucial to making a user friendly code than can be updated with ease or approached by a beginner and still understand the use of each part of the program. Lastly, 

maintainability: consistant naming (range use i j k l etc) 
python is a modular language, follow that principle 
better the readability the better maintainibility
