# Lab 1

The first lab assignment we was given in the first week was a Guessing Game. In this lecture we learnt the basic of python and made the game. In this project a random number is generated when you run the program and the user has to find the number by guessing. You have 10 tries to find it and each time you make a guess the program will give you a hint and tell you whether the number is higher or lower. If you run out of tries the program will display a message saying you lost and end the program. However, if you win and guess the correct number you will be granted a victory message and the program will end.

# Lab 5

In the 5th Lab activity we were tasked with making a sudoku game where the user can input a row, column and number to play a sudoku game in python. This was a challenging task that was in my opinion the hardest seen as we had to make it using if statements. In the game the user will be displayed a sudoku board and the user can input a number where ever there is a "0". Additionally, if the user cannot place the number (an example being 2 numbers on the same row) then the program will tell the user that it is incorrect. Below is the sudoku board I used as a template and to get the user thinking and below is the solution.

# Lab 6

In Lab 6 the task was to make a task manager for days of the weeks and months of the year using while loops. These loops will make a continuous input system where the user can add tasks, view tasks, delete tasks and exit the program. The program will always loop back to the main menu when the program has executed what the user input and the user can either continue using the program or exit it.

# code readability and maintainability

When coding, making comments and ensuring indentations are correct is essential to a good program. Firstly, it makes collaborating with other programmers easier; an example of this would be explaining parts of the project to other programmers and explaining the code with the assistance of the comments. Furthermore, if you are unable to explain the program to them, they can infer from the comments left by you previously to either continue on a collaborative work or understand how to use a program. On top of this, comments can be used to leave instructions to a partner in a project, which makes collaboration important between both individuals. Another aspect to consider about readability is indentation. Correct indentation is essential for a program to work in Python, and it makes the program look approachable. Furthermore, keeping a consistent use of indentation so the flow of the program stays the same throughout the whole project. When considering readability, naming schemes are important to the program to guarantee that the program stays the same and it is easy to understand. An example of proper naming is "student_table" or "studentTable". These are the most common forms of naming in programming and are crucial to making user-friendly code that can be updated with ease or approached by a beginner and still understand the use of each part of the program.


Maintainability is an important part of coding, as a good program will have future-proof code that can be updated and still work and a bad program would not be upgradeable. A consistent naming scheme is important to maintaining a program and ensuring its longevity; an example of consistent naming would be classing a range with "I, J, K, L" which are common Python naming schemes. Additionally, Python is a modular language so ensuring that features follow the principle of modular languages which run from top to bottom. This is important because you do not want your new updated code to only run after the old program is run; consider commenting out the old code you do not need so you can still see the progress of the program. Additionally, a well-maintained program will not break and not cause issues; this will lead to a better user experience with no bugs that could potentially ruin the experience of the program for the user. Following on from this, if there are any issues that arise, a well-maintained program will be easier to fix and debug compared to a non-maintained program, as this one would not have comments pointing the debugger in a direction. Another point to make about maintainability is with the scalability of the code; a well-kept program can and will expand and if you do not have a maintained program, that could not only lead to issues expanding but also issues with pre-existing parts of the program.


Lastly, to close things out, the better the readability of the program the easier the maintainability of the program will be by following naming schemes, proper documentation, collaborative efforts and commenting.
